# caffe-load-same-weight-in-different-branch
when I try to reproduce the paper:Learning Discriminative Features with Multiple Granularities for Person Re-Identification in caffe. I find that initialize different branch with same pre-trained weights is a problem. Because the different branchs has different name.
